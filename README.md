# Armstrong Studio

Armstrong Studio is a clean Next.js 14 starter that strips away the default boilerplate so you can get straight to building. The repository ships with:

- App Router and React Server Components
- Tailwind CSS configured with sensible defaults
- shadcn/ui primitives ready to extend
- TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier for a modern developer experience

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the local dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then head to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to explore the refreshed landing page. Replace the copy, sections, and components with your own product experience as you iterate.

## Project Structure

- `app/` – Application routes, layouts, and global styles
- `components/` – Reusable UI primitives sourced from shadcn/ui
- `lib/` – Utilities and shared helpers
- `public/` – Static assets

## Next Steps

1. Update the brand identity (colors, typography, imagery) to match your product.
2. Define your domain models and data layer under `lib/`.
3. Add real content sections or feature modules inside `app/`.
4. Configure CI/CD and deployment targeting your preferred platform.

You now have a solid foundation that is free of placeholder content and ready for rapid iteration.
